# ATARI-IC-SERVICE-LABELS

This repository contains a printable PDF file named **ATARI-IC-SERVICE-LABELS.pdf**. The document provides labeled pinouts for key integrated circuits (ICs) used in Atari systems. These labels can be printed on adhesive paper (A4 size), cut out, and applied to the respective ICs. This makes it easier to verify connections and troubleshoot Atari motherboards during repairs or modifications.

## Features

- Pinouts for the following Atari ICs:
  - **6502C**
  - **ANTIC**
  - **GTIA**
  - **POKEY**
  - **PIA**
  - **FREDDIE**
- Labels are clearly marked for easy identification.
- Designed to fit common adhesive paper sheets (A4).

## How to Use

1. **Download the PDF**
   - Clone this repository or download the **ATARI-IC-SERVICE-LABELS.pdf** file directly.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ATARI-IC-SERVICE-LABELS
   ```

2. **Print the PDF**
   - Use an A4 adhesive paper sheet for printing.
   - Make sure the scale is set to **100%** to maintain the correct label size.

3. **Cut Out the Labels**
   - Carefully cut out the labels for each IC.

4. **Apply the Labels**
   - Place the corresponding label on each IC in your Atari system.
   - Ensure the labels are properly aligned with the pins for accurate reference.

## Benefits

- Simplifies checking connections on Atari motherboards.
- Speeds up troubleshooting and modifications.
- Helps organize and identify ICs during service.
